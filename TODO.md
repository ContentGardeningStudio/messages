# TODO List
This is a just some items that I would like the package to be able to do; however, please feel free to add features that are not on this list!

## General upgrades:
1.  Make messages **asynchronous**.  I would like each message to be non-blocking, so any application or program using this package does not get help-up waiting for network I/O.

## Email module:
1.  Ensure that all file types can be attached and sent.
2.  The package only uses **SMTP** for the email sessions, but perhaps features or logic should be added to use other protocols, like **ESMPT** or others, without complicating the interface/API.

## Text module:
1.

## Chat module:
1.

## Other modules:
1.  Please help me create other modules that allow any sort of message sending functionality.  Any unique protocol, web API service, etc. that you use!
